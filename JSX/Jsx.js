/*JSX stands for JavaScript Syntax Extension, 
and it lets you use HTML-like syntax in your React components.
A function called React.createElement() enables us to create JSX elements in React.
It accepts three arguments – the HTML element, an object containing the HTML element’s attribute, and the content of the HTML element.
JSX is JavaScript XML, which allows us to write HTML in React. It introduces XML-like tags and attributes to create React elements.
It makes it easy to create React Components by letting you write HTML-like code in .js*/

//Example is given here for jsx when changing the style of HTML in the components section without adding or changing much code

fucntion Application() {
  return (
    <div>
  <h2 classname="heading"> This is my name </h2>
    <form classname="Adding"> Choose one form out of these</form>
  <p> This is whole paragraph including messages
    </div>
